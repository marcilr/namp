nmap - Network exploration tool and security / port scanner


Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
exploration and security auditing.  It was designed to rapidly
scan large networks, although it works fine against single
hosts.  Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine
what hosts are available on the network, what services
(application name and version) those hosts are offering,
what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running,
what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens
of other characteristics. While Nmap is commonly used for
security audits, many systems and network administrators find
it useful for routine tasks such as network inventory,
managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or
service uptime.
